# nss: Numerical Series Solver
An algorithm to help solve numerical series test, such as IBM IPAT.  
It includes 25 examples of series in which you must find the next number in the series, and they're not as easy as you might think.  
The job of the algorithm is not to give you the answer, but to help you figure out the answer by implementing multiple algorithm to clarify any possible pattern.
